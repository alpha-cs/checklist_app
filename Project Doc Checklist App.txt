
Project Documentation: Checklist Application
Project Overview
You are tasked with developing a Checklist Application with a focus on modularity, scalability, reusability, and a user-friendly GUI. The application will feature multiple tabs including user account management, a timer, statistics tracking, and customizable settings. The backend will utilize a MySQL database, and the frontend will be built using a suitable Python GUI framework.

Project Structure
Your development should adhere to the following project structure for maintainability and scalability:

main.py: Entry point of the application.
gui/: Contains GUI components.
app_gui.py: Main GUI class.
tab_user.py: User account tab.
tab_timer.py: Timer tab.
tab_stats.py: Statistics tab.
tab_settings.py: Settings tab.
database/: Database interactions.
db_manager.py: Manages database operations.
models/: Data models/schemas.
user.py, task.py, statistic.py, setting.py: Model files.
services/: Business logic.
user_service.py, task_service.py, stat_service.py, setting_service.py: Service files.
utils/: Utility functions/resources.
config.py: Configuration settings.
helpers/: Common helper functions.
errors/: Error handling and logging.
error_handler.py: Centralized error handling.
logs/: Directory for log files.
tests/: Unit and integration tests.
assets/: Graphical assets (icons, buttons, images).
Development Guidelines
1. Environment Setup
Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
Set up a virtual environment for the project.
Install required packages (e.g., mysql-connector-python, GUI framework packages).
2. Database Setup
Create a MySQL database named windb.
Define tables as per the models in models/.
3. Coding Standards
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
Write clean, modular, and commented code.
Ensure code is well-documented.
4. GUI Development
Use the chosen Python GUI framework to develop the interface.
Ensure the interface is intuitive and accessible.
Incorporate assets from the assets/ directory for aesthetic enhancement.
5. Database Integration
Implement database operations in db_manager.py.
Ensure secure and efficient database transactions.
6. Business Logic
Develop the application's core functionalities in the services/ directory.
Ensure business logic is decoupled from the GUI and database layers.
7. Error Handling and Logging
Implement robust error handling in error_handler.py.
Log errors and important events in the logs/ directory.
8. Testing
Write unit and integration tests in the tests/ directory.
Ensure comprehensive test coverage.
9. Version Control
Use Git for version control.
Commit changes regularly with clear, descriptive messages.
Deliverables
Fully functional Checklist Application.
Complete source code with the specified directory structure.
Documentation for setup, configuration, and usage.
Comprehensive test suite with documentation.
Additional Notes
Prioritize user experience in GUI design.
Ensure scalability and future extensibility of the application.
Stay aligned with the project's objectives and milestones.
